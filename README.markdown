# Modified Version
This branch is:
Cake 2.3 MOD (Mark Scherer)

There are some core issues that need to be addressed.
Some are not fixed for various reasons. Therefore I use this "hacked" core to assert proper functionality in my apps.

See `/lib/Cake/!CHANGES_TO_CORE!.txt` for details.

Don't use if you don't know what you are doing!
